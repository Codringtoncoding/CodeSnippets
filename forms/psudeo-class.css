/* A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus */

selector:pseudo-class {
    property: value;
  }

/* unvisited link */
a:link {
    color: #FF0000;
  }
  
  /* visited link */
  a:visited {
    color: #00FF00;
  }
  
  /* mouse over link */
  a:hover {
    color: #FF00FF;
  }
  
  /* selected link */
  a:active {
    color: #0000FF;
  }

/*Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition
in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition
in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive. */
/* 
Match the first <p> element
In the following example, the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element: */

Example
p:first-child {
  color: blue;
}

In the following example, the selector matches the first <i> element in all <p> elements:

p i:first-child {
    color: blue;
}
