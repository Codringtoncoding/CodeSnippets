//steps of decompostion - write in english

//2. create a square board and divide it up into 100 smaller squares so that they are all
//the same size 

//3. label the squares from left-right from 1-100 starting from the bottom left
//at the end of the row e.g sqaure 10 move up one column and label the rows from right to 

//4. do for all numbers to 100.


//snakes


//4. draw 5 snakes of varying length randomly on the board with the heads at a higher number then the tails

//do step 4 with ladders tops at higher numbers then the feet

//6. neither the heads or the tops of the ladders can be on the number 100
//they both have to start and finish on different columns 

//rules of the game


//7. create 2 pieces to play with or how ever many you want up to 5.

//8. role a dice - whoever scores highest starts first.

//9. player who scores highest roles again (player 1)

//10.move to the counter to a sqaure that reflects dice score

//11.if you hit a ladder move up to the top

//12.if you hit a snake move down to the number corresponding to the tail

//13. repeat steps 10-12 until a player hits square 100.
